        Hello! In this task, you will be playing a
        cooking game. You will play one of two chefs
        in a restaurant that serves various soups.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Layouts</h3>
      <p>
        This is what one level of the game looks like:
      </p>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/training0.png" style="width:700px">

      <p>
        The picture below shows you a number of objects in the game with which you can interact:

      <h3 class="text-center">Movement and interactions</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/space-arrows.png" style="width:250px">
      <p>
        You can move up, down, left, and right using
        the <b>arrow keys</b>, and interact with objects
        using the <b>spacebar</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interact with objects by facing them and pressing
        <b>spacebar</b>. Here are some examples:
        <ul>
          <li>You can pick up ingredients (onions or tomatoes) by facing
            the ingredient area and pressing <b>spacebar</b>.</li>
          <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing an empty counter,
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you put the ingredient on the counter.</li>
          <li>If you are holding an ingredient, are facing a pot that is not full,
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will put the ingredient in the pot.</li>
          <li>If you are facing a pot that is non-empty, are currently holding nothing, and 
            and press <b>spacebar</b>, you will begin cooking a soup.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
        Note that as you and your partner are moving around the kitchen
        you <u><b>cannot occupy the same location</b></u>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Cooking</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/soup.png" style="width:250px">
      <p>
        Once you putt all ingredients in the pot, you can begin cooking a soup by pressing 
        <b>spacebar</b>. You can place 3 different ingredients in a pot 
        before cooking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a soup begins cooking, you'll notice a red number appear over the pot to 
        denote the cook time. This number counts upward until the soup is done.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-center">Serving</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/serving-counter.png" style="width:800px">
      <p>
        Once the soup cooked you can take it with one of the white plates and serve it by bringing it to
        a grey serving counter.
      </p>

      <br>

      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Soups</h3>
      <p>
        There are different soup recipes that can be created from combinations of tomatoes
        and onions, each with its own icon. In the levels you play you will only receive orders consisting out of soups made from 2 onions and 1 tomato.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Ingredients</th>
          <th>Icon</th>
        </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>2 Onions, 1 Tomato</td>
                <td><img src="static/assets/new_sprites/soup_done_tomato_1_onion_2.png" style="width:75px;background-color: #e6b453;"></td>
              </tr>
      </table>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Orders</h3>
      <p>
        While you are free to cook any 3-ingredient soup you like, only some are worth points. 
        The <b>Orders</b> list shows which recipes will recieve points. This is important, 
        as any soup served not in this list will not count towards your score. The <b>Orders</b>
        list does not change throughout the duration of a level.
      </p>
      <p>To reiterate: <b>ANY SOUP COOKED THAT IS NOT IN THE ORDERS WILL NOT BE WORTH POINTS</b></p>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>


      <h3 class="text-center">Score</h3>
      <p>
        When go to the grey counter and serve the soup specified in the <b>Orders</b> list, 10 points are added to your score.
      </p>

      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Goal</h3>
      <img class="center" src="static/images/info-panel-new.png" style="width:500px">
      <p>
        Your goal in this task is to serve as many of the orders as you can
        before each level ends.
        The current order, time, and score are all displayed 
        in an info panel below the layout.
      </p>

      <br>

      <h3 class="text-center">Eye Tracker Calibration</h3>
      <p>
      Please inform the experimenter that you have finished reading the instructions. We will now calibrate the eye tracker. Afterwards you will play two levels of Overcooked. Have fun!
